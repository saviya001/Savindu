ðŸ”¥ **What I'm Up to**

Currently, Iâ€™m diving deep into:

- Java  
- Python  
- AI/Machine Learning  
- Developing Android Games  

I enjoy exploring different programming languages and applying what I learn to develop innovative projects with real-world impact. Each day brings a fresh chance to expand my abilities and take on challenges that help me grow. Iâ€™m always eager to push my boundaries and turn new ideas into reality, especially when learning feels like a game with levels and achievements.
